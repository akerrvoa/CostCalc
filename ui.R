# Define UI for Cost Estimator Shiny Application
# Author: Anne Kerr


# This application calculates the estimated costs two methods of implementing ServicePoint. 
# National is willing to subsidize the cost to implement for each of its affiliates,
# but wants to look at the cost options for various combinations of standalone and shared 
# implementations. This application allows the user to input several assumtion factors and, based
# on those factors, evaluate the cost of the various options. The assumption factors are input as 
# integers and the number of each type of implementation to evaluate is presented on a slider. As 
# as the user manipulates the slider, the given assumptions are taken into account and the estimated
# costs for the specified level are displayed in an output table.
